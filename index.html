Market Opportunity SKRM believes that current market conditions provide a rewarding investment environment for it to continue its acquisition of warehouse distribution centers. SKRM's unique relationships with sales and leasing brokers (as well as regional property owners) have enabled SKRM to preemptively purchase assets before they have come to the market for sale. This, combined with SKRM's extensive network of debt providers, has created a favorable climate to achieve above market returns for its investments.
